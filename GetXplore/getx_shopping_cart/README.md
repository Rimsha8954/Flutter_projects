# 🛒 Shopping Cart Module 🛍️

The **Shopping Cart Module** is a core feature for any e-commerce application, enabling users to dynamically add, remove, and manage items in their shopping cart. This module is built with simplicity, flexibility, and reusability in mind, making it easy to integrate into any Flutter application.

## Features 🐾
- **Add & Remove Items**: Add your favorite items to the cart and remove them with a click of a paw!
- **Dynamic Cart**: Items are added or removed dynamically, and the cart updates in real time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface that makes shopping feel like a breeze.

## 🛒 How It Works:
1. **Add Items to Cart**: Tap on the `+` button to add an item to your cart.
2. **Remove Items from Cart**: Tap the `-` button to remove an item or reduce the quantity.
3. **Track Cart**: Keep an eye on the total number of items in your cart in real-time.


## ⚙️ How to Integrate
1. **Add Module Files**: Copy the `shopping_cart_module` folder into your Flutter project's `lib/` directory.
2. **Import and Initialize**:
   - Import the `CartController`:
     ```dart
     import 'package:your_project/shopping_cart_module/controllers/cart_controller.dart';
     ```
   - Initialize the controller:
     ```dart
     final CartController cartController = Get.put(CartController());
     ```

3. **Use in Your App**:
   - Display the shopping cart UI:
     ```dart
     ShoppingCartView();
     ```
   - Access cart data anywhere:
     ```dart
     Obx(() => Text('Total Items: ${cartController.totalItems}'));
     ```

## 🖥️ Tech Stack:
- **Flutter**: Built with Flutter to provide a smooth and responsive UI across both Android and iOS.
- **GetX**: Using GetX for efficient state management—handling the cart's state reactively with minimal boilerplate.
- **Dart**: Core programming language for logic implementation.
