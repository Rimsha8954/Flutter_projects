# Tendify Admin App (Jewelry E-commerce Clone)

Tendify Admin is a **clone app** for managing a jewelry e-commerce platform. This project is created as a learning exercise to explore Flutter's capabilities in building an admin panel for managing products, orders, and users.

## Features (Implemented in the Clone)

- **Product Management**: 
  - Display a list of jewelry products.
  - Add, edit, and delete products locally.

- **Order Management**: 
  - Simulate viewing and managing customer orders.

- **Basic UI Components**:
  - Reusable widgets like product cards, order lists, and user profiles.
  - Simple and intuitive navigation using Flutter's routing system.
